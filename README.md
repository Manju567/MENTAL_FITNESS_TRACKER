# MENTAL_FITNESS_TRACKER
Mental Health Fitness Tracker This project aims to develop a Mental Health Fitness Tracker using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes datasets obtained from Kaggle and applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), train-test splitting, and various models including linear regression, Lasso regression, and random forest. The random forest model is found to be the most precise in predicting mental health fitness.

Prerequisites
